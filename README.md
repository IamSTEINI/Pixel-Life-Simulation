# 游릱 Pixel Life Simulation 游릴

游린游릲游릳游릴游릱游릵游릶拘拘

This project is a simple simulation of a pixel population with the ability to reproduce. The pixels are represented on a 2D grid and can reproduce under certain conditions. The simulation is live and displays the population changes in a graphical window using Pygame and Matplotlib.

## 游린Prerequisites

To run this project, the following components need to be installed:

- Python 3.10.x (USED)
- Pygame library
- Matplotlib library

## 游릲Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and use:
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/IamSTEINI/Pixel-Life-Simulation.git
    ```
    then
    ```python
      pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Make sure **Python**, **Pygame**, and **Matplotlib** are installed.

3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal or command prompt.

4. Run the command `python main.py` to start the simulation.

## 游릳Functionality


The Pixel Life Simulation is based on a simple algorithmic logic:

1. The grid is initialized, and the initial population is randomly placed with different DNA variants.

2. In a loop, the position of each pixel is checked to see if it can reproduce.

3. If a pixel has not reproduced yet, it searches for a vacant neighboring field in a random direction.

4. If a vacant field is found, there is a certain probability of reproduction.

5. If reproduction occurs, two offspring are generated and added to the population.

6. The grid is updated, and the simulation is redrawn in each iteration.

7. The simulation continues for a specified number of days (**DAYS**), and the population changes are displayed live in a graphical window.

8. The simulation ends when there are no more pixels that can reproduce or when the specified number of days is reached.

## 游릴Customization Options

- You can adjust the size of the grid (**GRID_SIZE**) to change the size of the map.

- The initial population (**POPULATION_SIZE**) can be modified to have more or fewer pixels.

- The speed of the simulation (**TIME_SPEED**) can be adjusted to change the speed of time (higher = slower).

- The probability of reproduction (**reproduction_probability**) can be changed to control the frequency of reproduction.

- The probability of death (**death_probability**) can be adjusted to control the likelihood of a pixel dying.

- The colors of the pixels can be customized by modifying the values in the `dna` list.

## 游릱Visualization

The simulation displays the changes in population and the most frequently occurring DNA in the console. Additionally, a line diagram is generated using Matplotlib, showing the frequencies of each DNA variant over time.

## 拘뜞roubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or errors while running the simulation, make sure that you have installed the required dependencies (**Python**, **Pygame**, and **Matplotlib**) and that they are up to date.
